## Python Game Projects

This repository contains a series of Python projects that demonstrate key programming concepts and culminates in the creation of a text-based alien game. The projects include a “Higher or Lower” guessing game, a module milestone connecting dictionaries and if-then statements, room connections, and building the foundation for the final text-based alien game.

# Projects Overview:

🎯 Higher or Lower Game
- A simple game where the player must guess a randomly generated number. The program will guide the player with hints, indicating if the guess is too high or too low. 🔢
- This project covers basic Python concepts, including conditionals, loops, and user input handling.

🛠️ Module Milestone Project: Connecting Dictionaries and If-Then Statements
- A module that introduces working with dictionaries and if-then statements in Python. 📚
- The project focuses on building a logic structure using conditionals and dictionaries to make decisions in the game.

👽 Text-Based Alien Game
- The final project, a text-based alien adventure game, showcases everything learned throughout the course. 🌌
- Players explore different rooms while trying to collect all items and reach the escape pod without ending up in the Alien Hive Room! 💥
- The game utilizes lots of ASCII art, loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and functions to create an interactive and engaging experience.

## ** Getting Started **

-To run the game on your local machine, follow the instructions below.
