# Python Game Projects

This repository contains a series of Python projects that demonstrate key programming concepts and culminates in the creation of a text-based alien game. The projects include a “Higher or Lower” guessing game, a module milestone connecting dictionaries and if-then statements, room connections, and building the foundation for the final text-based alien game.

--Projects Overview

1. Higher or Lower Game

	•	A simple game where the player must guess a randomly generated number. The program will guide the player with hints, indicating if the guess is too high or too low.
	•	This project covers basic Python concepts, including conditionals, loops, and user input handling.

3. Module Milestone Project: Connecting Dictionaries and If-Then Statements

	•	A module that introduces working with dictionaries and if-then statements in Python.
	•	The project focuses on building a logic structure using conditionals and dictionaries to make decisions in the game.
	•	In this part of the project, the code sets up the foundational logic for a text-based adventure game, including room connections and handling player choices.
	•	This section explores the use of dictionaries for storing room information and logic for connecting different parts of the game world.

5. Text-Based Alien Game

	•	The final project, a text-based alien adventure game, showcases everything learned throughout the course.
	•	Players explore different rooms, while trying to collect items all items and reach the escape pod  without going the wrong direction to end up in the Alien Hive Room! 
	•	The game utilizes lots of ASCII art, loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and functions to create an interactive and engaging experience.

** Getting Started **

-To run the game on your local machine, follow the instructions below.

Prerequisites:

	•	Python 3.x or higher

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/ninirob/TextBasedGame.git

 	2.	Navigate to the project directory:
  cd TextBasedGame

	3.	(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
  .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
  
	4.	Run the games:
  python textbasedgame.py

How to Play

	•	After running the textbasedgame.py file, you’ll interact with the game through text-based prompts in the terminal.
	•	You’ll navigate through rooms, collect items, and try to avoid the villain in the game. Use the game’s prompts to guide your actions and make decisions.
	•	The objective is to collect all the items before encountering the villain. Your choices will determine the outcome of the game.

Key Features

	•	Room Exploration: Navigate through different rooms in  the spacecraft, each with unique items.
	•	Item Collection: Collect items to progress through the game and win.
	•	Alien Interactions: Encounter alien characters that add depth to the narrative.
	•	Dynamic Gameplay: The game reacts to player choices, providing a different experience with each playthrough.
